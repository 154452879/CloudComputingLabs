## 1. Overview

Implement a simple distributed in-memory key-value database (KV store) by your own, using two-phase commit protocol to guarantee the consistency and robustness of your KV store.

### Goals

* Get to know the problems and difficulties in building a distributed system;
* Know how to use a simple protocol to maintain consistency between multiple distributed servers;
* Use some simple schemes to handle server failures.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 KV store

An in-memory key-value database (also called **key-value store**, or **KV store** in this document) is a database that keeps all its data in the main memory and uses a simple key-value data structure. 

Typically, a KV-store exposes the following methods for users to store/delete/read data to/from the databases:

- **set(key, value)**: stores the value "value" with the key "key" (some KV stores also call this command as "**put**").
- **del(key)**: deletes any record associated with the key "key".
- **value=get(key)**: retrieves and returns the value associated with the key "key".

In practice, in-memory KV store serves most user requests only with data stored in the main memory, meanwhile, it often backups its data in the hard disks thus to be durable. However, in this lab, you are not required to consider the data durability (i.e., you can only store the data in main memory).  

### 2.2 Distributed KV store

In large-scale cloud services, KV stores are often built in distributed manner, for the sake of **performance and robustness**.   

For example, a KV store may distribute its data in multiple server machines, and simultaneously use those servers to serve user requests. As such, user requests can be evenly balanced to multiple servers when the load is high, and the database can survive from the failure of some servers.

However, when the KV database is distributed, many problems arise. Among those problems, **consistency issue** may be most notorious and toughest one. For example, assume that a KV database uses two servers A and B to hold data and serve user requests. When user 1 put some key at server A, and then after a very short time user 2 and 3 each posts a get request of this key to server A and B, respectively, then how to make sure that user 2 and 3 both **get the same latest value of this key**? What is more challenging, failures can happen on servers and networks when users are posting requests.

Next, we will introduce a very simple but classic protocol to ensure consistency among distributed database servers.

### 2.3 Two-phase commit

Now we describe possibly the simplest (but it works!) consensus protocol called **two-phase commit**, or **2PC**. This protocol can ensure the data consistency when the database is located on multiple distributed servers, that is, **two or more machines agree to do something, or not do it, atomically**. Note that this is only a very short introduction. You are encouraged to search more materials if you have further questions (e.g., [this](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1at411y7iQ) is a good video about 2PC).

Frist, 2PC maintains a **commit log** on each machine, which keeps track of whether commit has happened. Log is used to guarantee that all machines either commit or donâ€™t. 

Second, there is **one global coordinator**. It receives transactions from clients (e.g., set/delete/get) and reply results to clients, and coordinates multiple database servers, to ensure either all servers commit the transaction or all abort it.

Based on above architecture, 2PC operates in two distinct phases: 

1) The first phase is **prepared phase**. The global coordinator requests that all database servers (called participants) will promise to commit or rollback the transaction (e.g., set or delete a key) . Participants record promise in log, then acknowledge. If anyone votes to abort, coordinator writes "Abort" in its log and tells everyone to abort; each records "Abort" in log. 

2) The second phase is **commit-or-abort phase**. After all participants respond that they are prepared, then the coordinator writes "Commit" to its log. Then the coordinator asks all participants to commit; All participants respond with ACK. After receive ACKs, the coordinator writes "Got Commit" to log.

The detailed steps in 2PC are as follows:

***Prepared phase:*** 

1)&ensp;To commit the transaction, the coordinator starts by sending a **REQUEST-TO-PREPARE** message to each
participant.

2)&ensp;The coordinator waits for all participants to "vote" on the request.

3)&ensp;In response to receiving a **REQUEST-TO-PREPARE** message, each participant votes by sending a message back to the coordinator, as follows:

- It votes **PREPARED** if it is prepared to commit.
- It may vote **NO** for any reason, usually because it cannot prepare the transaction due to a local failure.
- It may delay voting indefinitely, for example, because the network drops the vote.

***Commit-Or-Abort phase:***

1)&ensp;If the coordinator receives **PREPARED** messages from all participants, it decides to commit. The transaction is now officially committed. Otherwise, it either received a **NO** message or gave up waiting for
some participant, so it decides to abort.

2)&ensp;The coordinator sends its decision to all participants (i.e.,**COMMIT** or **ABORT**).

3)&ensp;Participants acknowledge receipt of the commit or abort by replying **DONE**.

4)&ensp;After receiving **DONE** from all participants, the coordinator can reply clients with the transaction result (either success or failed), and *forget* the transaction, meaning that it can deallocate any memory it was using to keep track of information about the transaction.

## 3. Your Lab Task

### 3.1 Implement a simple distributed key-value store

#### 3.1.1 Task overview

<img src="src\KVStoreOverview.jpg" alt="KVStoreOverview" style="zoom:50%;" />

You need to implement a simple distributed KV store. Your KV store should run as a network service on remote machine(s), which can receive clients' operations on the database and return results to clients, through network messages. To cope with failures, your are required to implement your KV store services on multiple machines (which are connected with each other through network). Use 2PC protocol to maintain database consistency among multiple machines. 

To simplify the task, your KV store data is only stored in main memory. Also, the log in 2PC protocol is also only stored in main memory. 

Detailed lab requirements are discussed below.

#### 3.1.2 KV store command formats

Your KV store servers are only required to support three database commands: `SET`, `GET` and `DEL` commands (case sensitive). These commands (including arguments) and the return results are encapsulated into network messages using dedicated message format. For simplicity, all the keys and values are stored as strings in your KV store. 

Further details are as follows:

##### 3.1.2.1 Network message format

In this lab, you should use a **simplified version** of RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) message format to pass KV store commands from clients to servers (called request message) and pass command results from server to clients (called response message) . Specifically:

###### 3.1.2.1.1 Client request message

Clients send commands to the server using RESP Arrays (more details see `section 3.1.2.2`). RESP Arrays consist of:

- A `*` character as the first byte, followed by the number of elements in the array as a decimal number, followed by CRLF.
- Arbitrary number of bulk strings (up to 512 MB in length).

The bulk string consist of:

- A `$` byte followed by the number of bytes composing the string (a prefixed length), terminated by CRLF.
- The actual string data.
- A final CRLF.

For example, the string `CS06142` is encoded as follows:

`$7\r\nCS06142\r\n`

The bulk string `$7\r\nCS06142\r\n` start with a `$` byte, and the following number 7 indicate that the length of string `CS06142` is 7. Then, the terminated CRLF, actual string data `CS06142` and the final CRLF are next, consecutively.

###### 3.1.2.1.2 Server response message

1)&ensp;Success message: 

Success messages are encoded in the following way: a plus '+' character, followed by a string that cannot contain a CR or LF character (no newlines are allowed), terminated by CRLF (that is "\r\n").

For example, the `SET` command reply with just "OK" on success (more details see `section 3.1.2.2`):

`+OK\r\n`

2)&ensp;Error message:

Like success messages, error messages consist of: a minus '-' character, followed by a string, terminated by CRLF.

For example, if an error occurs, just return (more details see `section 3.1.2.2`):

`-ERROR\r\n` 

3)&ensp;RESP Arrays message:

Your server should return an RESP Arrays message when the `GET` command executed successfully (more detail see `section 3.1.2.2`).

For example:

`*2\r\n$5\r\nCloud\r\n$9\r\nComputing\r\n` 

4)&ensp;Integer message:

Some commands need to return an integer (e.g., `DEL` command, more details see `section 3.1.2.2`). An integer message is just a CRLF terminated string representing an integer, prefixed by a ":" byte.

An integer message example: 

`:1\r\n`

##### 3.1.2.2 Database commands

###### 3.1.2.2.1 SET command

`SET key value`

The function of the `SET` command is to set **key** to hold the string **value**. If key already holds a value, it is overwritten. For example, if you want to set key `CS06142` to hold the string `Cloud Computing`, the command would be:

`SET CS06142 "Cloud Computing"`

According to the message format we have discussed in `section 3.1.2.1`, this command would be encoded as a RESP message format:

`*4\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$7\r\nCS06142\r\n$5\r\nCloud\r\n$9\r\nComputing\r\n`

**Note:** The encoded message start with a `*` byte. The following number 4 indicate that there are 4 bulk strings in this message. These bulk strings are `$3\r\nSET\r\n`, `$7\r\nCS06142\r\n`, `$5\r\nCloud\r\n`, and `$9\r\nComputing\r\n`. 


If the `SET` operation succeeds, the server will return a success message; otherwise, return an error message.

For example, if the `SET` operation succeeds, the server just returns:

`+OK\r\n`

Otherwise, it returns:

`-ERROR\r\n`

###### 3.1.2.2.2 GET command

`GET key`

`GET` command can get the **value** of **key**. If the key does not exist the special value `nil` is returned.

For example, if you want to check the value of the key `CS06142`, construct the command like this:

`GET CS06142`

Like the `GET` command, this command should be encoded as a specific message format before sending to the server. 

`*2\r\n$3\r\nGET\r\n$7\r\nCS06142\r\n`

If the `GET` command was executed correctly, the value (encoded as RESP Arrays format) of the key will be returned. 

For example, if the command above executed correctly, return:

`*2\r\n$5\r\nCloud\r\n$9\r\nComputing\r\n`

, assuming the value of the key `CS06142` is`Cloud Computing`.

If the key does no exist, just return:

`*1\r\n$3\r\nnil\r\n`

###### 3.1.2.2.3 DEL command

The `DEL` command is used for removing one or more specified **keys** (arbitrary number, up to 512 MB message length). A key is ignored if it does not exist.

The `DEL` command should return the number of keys that were removed.

For example, if you want to delete key `CS06142` and key `CS162`, you can construct the `DEL` command:

`DEL CS06142 CS162`

Similar to the `SET` and `GET` commands, the `DEL` command will be encoded in RESP message as follows:

`*3\r\n$3\r\nDEL\r\n$7\r\nCS06142\r\n$5\r\nCS162\r\n`

The server will return the number of keys that were removed.

For example, if the `DEL` command above executed, return an integer message:

`:1\r\n`

**note:** Because we only set the key `CS06142` to hold a value. As for key `CS612`, it will be ignored because it does no exist. So, the number in the integer message is 1.

#### 3.1.3 Use 2PC protocol to build a KV store on multiple servers

You should implement the coordinator and participant program. 

The **coordinator** does not store any data. It only receives and parses KV commands from clients, runs 2PC protocol to coordinates participants to conduct the KV commands consistently, and reply command results to clients.  

Each **participant** maintains a KV database in its main memory, and conduct KV commands sent from the coordinator, and return results to the coordinator. 

You can use any message format for communication between the coordinator and participants. For example, you can also use the RESP format introduced before, or use some other RPC library.  

#### 3.1.4 Run your program

Enable long options to accept arguments in your program, just like the lab2. Required arguments are `--ip`, `--port`, and `--mode`.

The `--ip` and `--port` specify the IP address and the port. As for `--mode`, it indicates that the program your just started is a **coordinator** process or a **participant** process. For 

If your program is called **kvstore2pcsystem**:

run the **coordinator** process, just typing

`./kvstore2pcsystem --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --mode coordinator`

run the **participant** process, just typing

`./kvstore2pcsystem --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 8002 --mode participant`

When you run the command above, your program should run correctly.

#### 3.1.5 Implementation requirements

#### 3.1.5.1 Basic version

Your program should complete all the tasks described in `section 3.1.1-3.1.4` except `section 3.1.3.3`.

In basic version, your distributed system will not work properly when the **coordinator** crash. Feel free and it doesn't matter in the basic version.

#### 3.1.5.2 Advanced version

Your program should complete all the tasks described in `section 3.1.1-3.1.4` including `section 3.1.3.3`.

In advanced version, when the **coordinator** crash occurs, your distributed system should choose a new **coordinator** to make sure that the distributed system will keep working properly.
